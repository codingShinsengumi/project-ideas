This repository will keep track of a list of project ideas that members are invited to work on. If you are interested in working on one of the projects, update this repository as well. 

1. Today planner
   There are so many to-do applications and they are very easy to implement as well. This is also a todo application but with a different taste.
     * Default screen is today
     * A todo list should be there per each day.Every day the list should be updated and previous entries should only be shown if user said so.
     * Should be able to schedule reminders
     * Reminders scheduled for today should be visible on today screen
     * There should be a way to view and edit the other reminders
     * Separate the reminders by their status: (ex: future, past, today)
     * The UI should be distraction free.
